# Breast Cancer Winconsin
## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the diagnosis of breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project aims to build a model that can classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features extracted from biopsy samples.

## Dataset Description
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset, also known as the "WBC dataset," is a widely used dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset provides information on various characteristics of cell nuclei extracted from breast mass samples. It is commonly used for machine learning and data mining research related to breast cancer diagnosis.
### Dataset Details
* Number of Instances: 699
* Number of Attributes: 10
#### Attribute Information:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset includes the following attributes:
1. Sample code number: Unique identification number for each sample
2. Clump Thickness: Uniformity of cell size and shape
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: Uniformity of cell size
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: Uniformity of cell shape
5. Marginal Adhesion: Degree of adhesion to neighboring cells
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: Size of epithelial cells
7. Bare Nuclei: Presence of bare nuclei (missing values represented as "?")
8. Bland Chromatin: Degree of variation in chromatin shape
9. Normal Nucleoli: Normality of nucleoli
10. Mitoses: Number of mitotic figures
### Dataset Source
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset was collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg, W.N. Street, and O.L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The data was obtained from breast mass samples of patients who underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA).
